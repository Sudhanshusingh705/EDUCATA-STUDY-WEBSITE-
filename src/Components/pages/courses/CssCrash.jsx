We will be looking at styles, selectors, declarations, etc. We will build a CSS cheat sheet that you can keep as a resource and we will also create a basic website layout. We are using CSS3 but mostly the basics. I will be creating an advanced CSS course with animations, etc. I do have a Flexbox in 20 minutes video as well if you want to learn flexbox."
